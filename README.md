### What I learned

I learned a lot from this exercise, since I started with basically zero knowledge of HTML and CSS. I learned how to import fonts, how to position things on the screen, how to use box-shadows, how to round the corners of elements, and, most importantly, how to use Flexbox. I also learned how to use max-width to allow elements to resize to fit nicely on mobile.
